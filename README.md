# Arabic-Entity-Recognition
 implement a tool for Arabic entity recognition using a pretrained Word2Vec model and LSTM according to the following instructions:

• Loading Data: I am using the AQMAR dataset and applying the necessary tokenization and preprocessing on the Arabic data.

• Preparing Data: I am setting up the model inputs and outputs. It is best to split the data into samples, where each sample contains one sentence.

• Word2Vec Model: Loading a pretrained Word2Vec model in Arabic.

• Training: I am dividing the data into training and evaluation datasets. The outputs are the classes for each word.

• Testing: I enable the user to input any sentence. I predict the classes for each word in the sentence using my model and print the results clearly.
